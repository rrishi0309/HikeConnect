# HikeConnect - Product Concept

## 🚀 Project Overview
**HikeConnect** is a product concept created during my **Product Management course in Spring 2024**. It aims to unify trail navigation, safety features, and community building into a single, intuitive app for outdoor enthusiasts. The project involved a combination of **market research, user surveys, and UI/UX design** to outline a comprehensive product strategy.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Outdoor enthusiasts often have to use multiple platforms to access trail information, safety tools, and social features, leading to a fragmented experience. HikeConnect was conceived to address these pain points by providing a **centralized solution** that simplifies planning, ensures safety, and fosters a vibrant hiking community.

2. **Enhanced Safety**: Features include emergency SOS alerts, location tracking, and pre-hike itinerary sharing.
3. **Community Building**: Connect with fellow hikers, create groups, find trail buddies, and share hiking experiences through interest-based communities.
4. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Personalized trail suggestions based on user preferences, skill level, and desired difficulty.

## 📋 Product Strategy & Research
